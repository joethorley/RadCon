<h2>Analysing Source Trees</h2>

<hr>
<br>

<p>
The commands for analysing a set of <a 
href="trees.html#source and consensus trees" class="internal">source 
trees</a> are grouped together in the bottom half of the <a 
href="menus.html#source menu" class="internal">Source menu</a>.
</p>

<p>
The user should note that the commands are implemented on the subset of 
source trees that are both <a 
href="trees.html#selected and deselected trees" 
class="internal">selected</a> and <a 
href="trees.html#active and inactive trees" class="internal">active</a>.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="#tree weights" class="internal">weight</a> of a tree determines its influence on an analysis.
</p>

<p>
RadCon can calculate the <a href="#positional congruence command" 
class="internal">Positional Congruence</a> and <a 
href="#leaf stability command" class="internal">Leaf Stability</a> of the 
<a href="terms.html#leaf" class="internal">leaves</a> in the source trees. 
In addition RadCon can perform a <a href="#double decay analysis command" class="internal">Double Decay Analysis</a> 
on a set of MPTs and output the <a href="#adams consensus"
class="internal">Adams</a>, <a href="#strict component consensus"

<h2>Tree Weights</h2>
<p>
The influence of each tree on an analysis is determined by its weight 
relative to the other trees. Many tree programs assign the trees in a set 
equal weight. RadCon, however, allows differential weighting of trees. 
Consider a set of three source trees of weight 1. These three trees will
have equal influence on any analysis conducted. Imagine now that two of 
the trees are identical. If the two identical trees were to be condensed 
and the remaining copy assigned a weight of 2 then although one of the 
copies would have been deleted the remaining copy would now have twice the 
influence and the results of any analysis would be unaffected.

<h2>Positional Congruence</h2>

<p>
The Positional Congruence ( <a 
href="references.html#estabrook:1992:evaluating" 
class="internal">Estabrook, 1992</a>) of a <a href="terms.html#leaf" 
class="internal">leaf</a>  is a measure of the agreement, among a set of 
trees, about the position of the leaf.
<!--<a href="terms.html#cladistic" class="internal">cladistic</a> relationship of the leaf to the other leaves. -->
</p>

<p>
The Positional Congruence measures proposed by Estabrook (1992) are 
extensions of the tree congruence (similarity) measures proposed by <a 
href="references.html#estabrook:etal:1985:comparison" 
class="internal">Estabrook <i>et al.</i> (1985)</a>. These earlier authors 
defined one measure of the similarity of two <a href="terms.html#root" 
class="internal">unrooted</a> trees to be the fraction of the total number 
of the quartets which are resolved and of the same type in the two trees. 
They called this measure <em>EA Similarity</em> - the acronym EA standing 
for Explicitly Agree as a quartet must explicitly agree, i.e., be resolved 
and of the same type in the trees, for it to be counted.  Clearly in two 
identical <a href="terms.html#bifurcating" class="internal">bifurcating</a> 
trees all quartets will explicitly agree and they will have an EA 
Similarity of 1. On the other hand as two trees become more disimilar EA 
Similarity will decrease to 0.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/poscon.gif" alt="positional congruence output" height=228 
width=242 align=left hspace=12>
</p>

<p>
Estabrook's (1992) contribution was to extend the tree congruence measures 
of Estabrook <i>et al.</i> (1985) to measure, not the similarity of 
individual trees but instead, the similarity in placement of each leaf. 
This was done by considering, for each leaf, only the subset of quartets 
which include the leaf. Thus Estabrook (1992) defined the EA Similarity of 
a leaf in two unrooted trees to be the fraction of the total number of the 
quartets containing the leaf which are resolved and of the same type in the 
two trees. The user should be aware that the average EA Similarity of the 
leaves is the EA Similarity of the trees.
</p>

<p>
The congruence measures, for trees and leaves, proposed by Estabrook <i>et 
al.</i> (1985) and Estabrook (1992), can be readily extended to cases with 
rooted trees or more than two trees by considering <a 
href="terms.html#resolved triplet" class="internal">resolved triplets</a> and 
requiring explicit agreement across all the trees, respectively.
</p>

<p>
The figure illustrates typical output using an example from Estabrook 
(1992). The output shows that 66% of the total quartets are resolved and of 
the same type in the two trees, that 55% of the total quartets containing 
<i>dasy</i>, <i>pet</i>, <i>octo</i> and <i>myo</i> are resolved and of the 
same type and that there is more agreement between the two trees regarding 
the positions of the last three leaves than the other four.

<h2>Leaf Stability (LS)</h2>

<p>
It is important that phylogeneticists assess the <a 
href="terms.html#assessing support" class="internal">support</a>  for their 
<a href="terms.html#phylogenetic inference" class="internal">inferred</a> 
phylogenetic trees.
</p>

<p>
The <a name="leaf stability" class="definition">Leaf Stability</a> (<a 
href="references.html#thorley:wilkinson:1999:testing" 
class="internal">Thorley and Wilkinson, 1999</a> ) of a <a 
href="terms.html#leaf" class="internal">leaf</a> is a measure of the 
support for the position of that leaf. The method like <a 
href="#positional congruence command" class="internal">Positional Congruence</a> is 
quartet/triplet based and the rationale simple. The phylogenetic 
relationships of a set of leaves are a function of the relationships among 
each subset of four/three leaves (quartet/triplet). Stable and unstable 
leaves will tend to occur in stable and unstable quartets/triplets, 
respectively. The average stability of the quartets/triplets including a 
leaf provides a measure of the stability of that leaf.
</p>
<p>
<p>
RadCon currently provides the user with <a href="#leaf stability (bootstrap) command" class="internal">three</a> 
<a href="terms.html#bootstrap" 
class="internal">bootstrap</a> based measures of the stability of 
quartets/triplets and <a href="#leaf stability (decay index) command" class="internal">one</a> other measure based on 
the <a href="terms.html#decay index" class="internal">decay index.</a>

<h2>Leaf Stability (Bootstrap)</h2>

<p>
<img src="images/leafstab.gif" alt="leaf stability" height=313 width=278 
align=left hspace=12>
</p>

<p>
RadCon currently provides the user with three <a href="terms.html#bootstrap" 
class="internal">bootstrap</a> based measures of the stability of 
quartets/triplets. The first measure, <a name="maximum" 
class="definition">Maximum</a>, is the bootstrap proportion (BP) of the 
resolution of the quartet which occurs in the greatest proportion of 
bootstrap trees. The second measure, <a name="difference" 
class="definition">Difference</a>, is the difference between the BPs of the 
two resolutions of the quartet which occur in the greatest and second 
greatest proportion of bootstrap trees. The third measure <a name="difference" 
class="definition">Entropy</a> is the entropy of the BPs of the resolutions of the 
quartet.

Other LS measures based on the 
bootstrap or other methods for assessing the stability of 
quartets/triplets, i.e., the Decay Index, are possible.
</p>

<p>
The figure illustrates typical output using the example from Thorley and 
Wilkinson (1999). When either measure is used <i>Whatch</i> is the least 
stable leaf.

<h2>Leaf Stability (Decay Index)</h2>

<p>
	 The Leaf Stability (Decay Index) measure uses the <a href="terms.html#decay index" class="internal">decay index</a> 
	 to quantify the support for the position of each leaf in a 
	 set of Most Parsimonious Trees (MPTs)
</p>
	 
	 <p>
	The procedure for calculating this LS measure is identical to that for a <a href="#double decay analysis command" class="internal">Double Decay Analysis</a>.  
	In fact when a Double Decay 
	Analysis is performed the stabilities of the leaves in the MPTs, as measured by the Leaf Stability (Decay Index), are also provided. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Leaf Stability (Decay Index) is currently 
	available for sets of rooted and unrooted MPTs with no more than 50 and 25 leaves, respectively.
	</p>

	
<a name="double decay analysis command"></a>
<hr>
<br>

<h2>Double Decay Analysis</h2>

<p>
	 <a name="maximum" 
class="definition">Double Decay Analysis (DDA)</a> (the reader is referred 
to <a href="references.html#wilkinson:etal:2000:chain" class="internal">Wilkinson etal. (2000)</a> for a more complete exposition of the method)
provides a complete summary of the support, as measured by the <a href="terms.html#decay index" class="internal">decay index</a>, 
for all the full and partial <a href="terms.html#split" class="internal">splits</a> common to a set of most parsimonious trees (MPTs).
	</p>
<p>
	 Traditional Decay Analysis (TDA) only gives the support for the full splits.  The full splits are often poorly supported but the partial splits may have high levels of support.  
	 TDA consequently paints an incomplete and often misleading picture.
</p>
<p>
	 DDA first calculates the decay indices of all the triplets/quartets common to all the MPTs and then fuses them up to give the decay indices of all the more inclusive splits.
	 These splits along with their decay indices are presented in a partition table and a profile of support trees produced.  RadCon currently only calculates the 
	 set of basic support trees, which in and of themselves, capture all the information in the partition table.  However, the largest, most resolved or most informative support tree may be 
	 one of the derivative support trees, which are produced by fusing together one or more basic trees.  The next release of RadCon should allow the generation
	 of derivative support trees.
</p>
<p>
	 RadCon is unable to calculate the parsimony lengths of trees which necessitates the use of PAUP 4 (note this or later versions of PAUP must be used because 
	 the earlier versions cannot perform parsimony analysis with small backbone constraints) to calculate the decay indices of the triplets/quartets.  The following procedure should be followed:
	 
	 <ol>
			<li>In PAUP 4 open the data file.</li>
			<li>In PAUP 4 perform a parsimony analysis.</li>
			<li>In PAUP 4 save the set of MPTs to a file in NEXUS format.</li>
			<li>In RadCon open the NEXUS format file containing the MPTs.</li>
			<li>In RadCon select the Double Decay Analysis -> Output... command from the Source menu.</li>
			(Note RadCon currently only performs DDA on sets of rooted MPTs with no more than 50 leaves.)
			<li>In RadCon choose a single leaf to act as the outgroup leaf.</li>
			(Note A quartet is the smallest split on which characters can be mapped and so an outgroup leaf is required to act as the root or fourth leaf in each 'triplet.') 
			<li>In RadCon choose the search options.</li>
			<li>In RadCon name the file to which the backbone constraints and search options are to be saved.</li>
			<li>In PAUP 4  execute the file containing the backbone constraints and search options (with the original data set active)</li>
			<li>Wait for PAUP 4 to complete the searches.</li>
			<li>In RadCon select the Double Decay analysis -> Input... command from the Source menu (with the MPTs active).</li>
			<li>In RadCon choose the same leaf to act as the outgroup leaf again. </li>
			<li>In RadCon enter the length of the MPTs.</li>
			<li>In RadCon open the file containing the backbone constraints and search options.</li>
			<li>in RadCon open the file to which PAUP 4 logged the results of the searches.</li>
			(Note this file should be in the same folder as the file containing the backbone constraints and search options and should have the same name as this file
			followed by '.log.')
			<li>Wait while RadCon inputs and processes everything.</li>
			<li>Enjoy at your leisure!</li>

<h2>Consensus Methods and Trees</h2>

<p>
Consensus methods allow phylogeneticists to represents sets of trees in the 
form of consensus trees.
</p>

<p>
The plethora of available consensus methods is a reflection of the 
diversity of ways of achieving a consensus in the face of conflict. Many 
consensus methods can be classified according to the <a 
href="terms.html#tree substructure" class="internal">tree substructure</a> 
they capture and the level of agreement between the source trees required.
Consensus methods that fall within this classification are the 
Adams consensus method, the family of component consensus methods and the 
family of reduced consensus methods which capture <a 
href="terms.html#nesting" class="internal">nestings</a>, <a 
href="terms.html#full split" class="internal">full splits</a> and all (full 
and <a href="terms.html#partial split" class="internal">partial) 
splits</a>, respectively. With regard to the level of agreement strict, 
semi-strict and majority-rule consensus methods require total agreement, no 
conflict and greater than 50% agreement, respectively. So, for example, for 
an <a href="terms.html#internal branch" class="internal">internal 
branch</a> to appear in the strict component consensus tree the full split 
it corresponds to must have occurred in all the source trees.
</p>

<p>
RadCon provides the user with the <a href="#adams consensus" 
class="internal">Adams</a> (strict nesting), <a 
href="#strict component consensus" class="internal">strict component</a>, 
<a href="#strict basic reduced consensus" class="internal">strict basic 
reduced</a>, <a href="#semi-strict component consensus" 
class="internal">semi-strict component</a> and <a 
href="#majority-rule component consensus" class="internal">majority-rule 
component</a> consensus methods. These methods are grouped under the <span 
class="menucommand">Conventional Consensus</span> submenu (in the <a 
href="menus.html#source menu" class="internal">Source menu</a>) because 
they require the source trees to have identical sets of <a 
href="terms.html#leaf" class="internal">leaves</a>. In contrast <span 
class="menucommand">Supertree Consensus</span> methods do not require the 
source trees to have identical sets of leaves. Consensus methods in this 
second class are typically used to 'fuse' trees with different (but 
overlapping) sets of leaves to produce supertrees - consensus trees with 
all the leaves in at least one of the source trees. <a href="#mrp" 
class="internal">MRP</a> is the only supertree consensus method currently 
implemented in RadCon. See <a class="internal" href="references.html#sanderson:etal:1998:phylogenetic">Sanderson et 
al (1998)</a> for a review of supertrees and a discussion of MRP.

<h2>Adams (Strict Nesting) Consensus</h2>

<p>
It is fitting that we start our discussion of consensus methods here as the 
Adams was the first consensus method to be proposed (Adams, 
1972). The  method resolves conflict by pulling <a 
href="terms.html#leaf" class="internal">leaves</a>, which occur in variable 
positions on the source trees, down towards the <a href="terms.html#root" 
class="internal">root</a> of the consensus tree. (note: the method is only 
defined for set of <a href="terms.html#rooted" class="internal">rooted</a> 
source trees).
</p>

<p>
More formally the Adams consensus tree captures strict <a 
href="terms.html#nesting" class="internal">nestings</a>, i.e., the 
internal branches in the Adams consensus tree correspond to those nestings 
which occur in all the rooted source trees.
</p>

<p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="600" 
height="156">
    
    <tr>

    </tr>
    
</table>
</p>

<p>
Clearly, in the two source trees leaf 4 occurs in variable positions and in 
the Adams consensus tree has been pulled down to the internal node 
corresponding to the most recent common ancestor of the alternative 
positions. Even though this example is simple to understand it illustrates 
the problem of ambiguity which is a shortcoming of the Adams consensus 
method. The polytomy in the Adams consensus tree is ambiguous because it 
cannot be determined if leaf 3 and/or leaf 4 occurs in variable positions 
in the source trees. Ambiguity means that the Adams consensus tree may 
provide little cladistic <a href="measures.html#information" 
class="internal">information</a> despite being moderately <a 
href="measures.html#resolution" class="internal">resolved</a>.
</p>

<a name="strict component consensus"></a>
<hr>
<br>

<h2>Strict Component Consensus</h2>

<p>
Amid a slew of contradictory papers attempting to quantify the congruence 
(agreement) of various methods of <a 
href="terms.html#phylogenetic inference" class="internal">phylogenetic 
inference</a>, Sokal and Rohlf (1981) proposed a consensus method which 
produces a single consensus tree which displays all and only those <a 
href="terms.html#full split" class="internal">full splits</a> (components) 
occuring in all the source trees. Although more commonly referred to in the 
literature as the <em>strict consensus</em> method we adopt the consensus 
terminology of <a href="references.html#wilkinson:1994:common" 
class="internal">Wilkinson (1994)</a> which includes qualifiers specifiying 
both the agreement required between the source trees, i.e., strict, and the 
tree substructure captured, i.e., component.
</p>

</p>

<p>
The strict component consensus tree contains a single internal branch - 
that which partitions leaf 5 and the <a
href="terms.html#leaf" class="internal">root</a> from the remaining 
leaves - and corresponds to the only full split common to the two source 
trees. This example nicely  illustrates a potential limitation of the strict component 
consensus tree - its insensitivity, i.e. the tree is largely <a 
href="measures.html#resolution" class="internal">unresolved</a> despite the 
ocurrence of much shared <a href="terms.html#cladistic" 
class="internal">cladistic</a> structure.
</p>

<a name="strict reduced consensus"></a> <a 
name="strict basic reduced consensus"></a>
<hr>
<br>

<h2>Strict Reduced Consensus</h2>

<p>
The strict reduced consensus method has a more recent history than the 
Adams and strict component consensus methods. It was proposed by <a
href="references.html#wilkinson:1994:common" class="internal">Wilkinson 
(1994)</a> to overcome the limitations of these two earlier methods, i.e., 
ambiguity and insensitivity, respectively. Informally, the method can be 
described as overcoming these 
problems through the exclusion from the consensus tree of leaves whose 
variability in position prevents unambiguous representation of the remaining 
leaves. Often different combinations of leaves can be excluded to achieve 
unambiguity a phenomenon that results in the method outputting a set or 
<em>profile</em> of 
strict reduced consensus trees. 
More formally, the method identifies
the full and partial splits common to the source trees and represents them in 
the form of one of more trees. 
</p>
<p>
The user should be aware that trees in the same reduced consensus profile 
are not conflicting alternatives. The trees in the same profile are 
compatible and complementary and each provides additional information about 
the relationships common to the source trees. If a choice is necessary the 
user can use <a href="measures.html#information" class="internal">Cladistic Information Content</a> 
(CIC) to identify the most informative tree.
</p>
<p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="800" 
height="156">
    
    <tr>
	<td><img src="images/consensussource1.gif" alt="a source tree"width="200"

	align="center">strict reduced 1</td><td 
	align="center">strict reduced 2</td>
    </tr>
    
</table>
</p>


<p>
In the above example there are two trees in the strict reduced consensus 
profile with CICs of 2.807 and 3.907 bits, respectively. 
</p>
<p>
The user should be aware that RadCon currently only produces the basic 
strict reduced consensus profile of a set of source trees. Although the 
basic trees capture all the split information common to the source trees 
it is often possible to fuse basic trees to produce derivative trees 
(Wilkinson, 
1995). Derivative trees represent new combinations of the split 
information in the basic trees and the tree with the highest CIC may be a 
derivative tree. Derivative strict reduced consensus trees will be added 
to a later version of RadCon.
</p>

<a name="semi-strict component consensus"></a>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Semi-Strict Component Consensus</h2>
<p>
The semi-strict component consensus method, which is also known as the 
combinable components consensus method, was developed by Bremer (1982).
The method produces a single consensus tree whose internal 
branches represent full splits which occur in at least one of the 
source trees and are compatible with all the source trees. 
</p>
<p>
The consensus tree produced will only differ from the strict component 
consensus tree if one or more of the source trees contains a <a
href="terms.html#polytomy" class="internal">polytomy</a>.

<a name="majority-rule component consensus"></a>
<hr>
<br>

<h2>Majority-Rule Component Consensus</h2>
<p>
The majority-rule component consensus method was developed by Margush and 
McMorris. The internal branches in the single consensus tree 
correspond to those full splits (components) which occur in more than half 
the source trees. Typically the internal branches are labelled with their
frequency of occurrence in the source trees. The method is useful when a 
well resolved consensus tree is required. Additional resolution can be 
achieved by adding minority-compatible components, i.e., components which 
occur in less than 50% of the source trees and do not conflict with the 
components currently in the consensus tree.
</p>
<p>
The method is most commonly used for summarising the results of a 
<a href="terms.html#bootstrap" class="internal">bootstrap</a> analysis. It 
is well suited for this purpose as the consensus tree displays the best supported full 
splits with their BPs (note: the frequency of occurrence 
of a full split in a set of bootstrap trees is its BP).

<h2>Show All Components</h2>

<p>
RadCon also gives the user the option to list, in the <a
href="windows.html#log window" class="internal">Log window</a>, all the components (full 
splits) that occur in the source trees with their frequency of occurrence 
(note: when the trees are a set of <a href="terms.html#bootstrap" 
class="internal">bootstrap</a> 
trees the frequency of occurrence of a full split is its BP). Displaying all 
full splits allows the user to assess the support for, or stability of, 
alternative hypothesis. In addition RadCon is able to calculate the 
difference between the frequency of each full split and its strongest 
competitor, i.e., the frequency of the incompatible split which occurs in 
the greatest proportion of the trees. If the incompatible split occurs in a 
greater proportion of the trees then the difference will be negative.

<h2>MRP</h2>
<p>
MRP, which stands for Matrix Representation with Parsimony analysis, was 
independently proposed as a way of combining trees by <a href="references.html#baum:1992:combining" class="internal">Baum (1992)</a>  and 
<a href="references.html#ragan:1992:phylogenetic" class="internal">Ragan (1992)</a>. MRP is a supertree consensus method as the source trees are 
not required to have identical sets of <a href="terms.html#leaf"
class="internal">leaves</a>. RadCon converts a set of source trees into 
a matrix of binary characters for input into PAUP. The trees can be represented 
as components or <a href="terms.html#resolved triplet" class="internal">resolved triplets/quartets</a> if 
<a href="terms.html#root" class="internal">rooted/unrooted</a>. The only 
limitation is that the number of cells in the matrix is less than 10<sup>6</sup>.
