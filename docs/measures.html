The two trees above have IBs of 0 and 3, respectively.RadCon only calculates this measure for trees which are <ahref="terms.html#root" class="internal">rooted</a> and <a href="terms.html#bifurcating" class="internal">bifurcating</a> as it is not defined for trees which are unrooted or contain <a href="terms.html#polytomy" class="internal">polytomies</a>. <p>The maximum possible imbalance of a tree, IB<sub>max</sub>, is the imbalance it would have if it was pectinate. IB<sub>max</sub> = (n-1)(n-2)/2 where n is the <a href="#size" class="internal">size</a> of the tree.</p><p>The minimum possible imbalance of a tree,  IB<sub>min</sub>, is the imbalance it would have it it was as balanced as possible. The most balanced tree with four leaves, the first tree above, is completely symmetrical and IB = 0. Thus IB<sub>min</sub> = 0 for n = 4. However try adding an additional leaf. The most balanced tree on five leaves has an imbalance of 2 and thus IB<sub>min</sub> = 2 for n = 5. RadCon calculates calculate the minimum possible imbalance,  IB<sub>min</sub>, of a tree using a recursive formula whereby each recursion divides n (the number of leaves) into two equal or nearly equally (size difference of 1) partitions.</p><p>It seems natural to normalise IB by dividing IB by IB<sub>max</sub> so that maximally imbalanced trees have a normalised imbalance of 1.00. However consider the example of the most balanced tree on 5 leaves. Using this method, this tree would have a normalised imbalance of 2 / 6 = 0.333. This implies that the tree is not as balanced as it could be which is not the case as the tree is the most balanced tree on 5 leaves. RadCon gives the user the option to normalise IB  using a 'corrected' method which divides IB - IB<sub>min</sub> by IB<sub>max</sub> - IB<sub>min</sub>.Using this corrected method the most balanced and most imbalanced trees, for any n, will have normalised imbalances of 0 and 1, respectively.</p><p>The balance of a tree is quite simply IB<sub>max</sub> - IB and the normalised balance of a tree is 1 - the normalised imbalance (for both the uncorrected and corrected methods).</p><a name="information content"></a><a name="information"></a><hr><br><h2>Information Content</h2><p>The information content of a tree is a measure of how much it reduces uncertainty regarding phylogenetic relationships.</p><p><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="400" height="156">    <tr>	<td width="200" height="154"><img src="images/balancedtree.gif" alt="an informative tree" width="200" height="154" border="0"></td>	<td width="200" height="154"><img src="images/unresolvedtree.gif" alt="a uninformative tree" width="200" height="154" border="0"></td>    </tr>          <tr>	<td border=0 width="200" height="2" align=center>Tree1</td>	<td border=0 width="200" height="2" align=center>Tree2</td>    </tr>  </table><p>In the above figure Tree1 eliminates all uncertainty regarding the phylogenetic relationships whilst Tree2 does not reduce the uncertainty at all and isclearly uninformative. </p><p>RadCon quantifies the amount of <a href="terms.html#cladistic" class="internal">cladistic</a> information provided by a tree, in bits, using <a href="references.html#thorley:etal:1998:information" class="internal">Thorley etal's (1998)</a> Cladistic Information Content (CIC) measure.</p><p>Thorley etal (1998) defined the CIC of a tree to be the negative log<sub>2</sub> of the ratio of the number of <a href="terms.html#bifurcating" class="internal">bifurcating</a><a href="terms.html#cladogram" class="internal">cladograms</a> <em>permitted</em> by the tree to the number of possible bifurcating cladograms. A cladogram is permitted by tree if it is a possible resolution of that tree.The number of possible bifurcating cladograms is (2n-3)!! or (2n-5)!! if the trees are <ahref="terms.html#root" class="internal">rooted</a> or <ahref="terms.html#root" class="internal">unrooted</a>, respectively, where n is the <a href="#size" class="internal">size</a> of the tree. The CIC of a tree is normalised, i.e., made to range between 0 and 1, by dividingby the maximum possible CIC, i.e. if the tree is <a href="terms.html#bifurcating" class="internal">bifurcating</a> and only permits itself, which is log<sub>2</sub>(2n-3)!! or log<sub>2</sub>(2n-5)!! if the tree is rooted or unrooted, respectively.</p><p>The two trees above have a CICs of -log<sub>2</sub>(1/15) = 3.907 bits and -log<sub>2</sub>(15/15) = 0 bits, respectively and normalised CICs of1 and 0, respectively.</p><p>Because the number of possible trees increases exponentially (explosively) this can cause computational problems with large n. To avoid exponent  CIC is currently only calculated for trees with up to 150 leaves.</p><!-- #include file=":INCLUDE:gototoc.html" --><hr><br><p>Go to the <a href="manual.html#contents" class="internal">Table of Contents</a>.</p><!-- /#include --><hr><br><!-- #lastmodified text="This page was last modified" form="long" -->This page was last modified May 3, 2001<!-- /#lastmodified --></p><!-- #include file=":INCLUDE:end.html" --><p>This page is maintained by <a HREF="mailto:joe@poissonconsulting.ca" class="external">joe@poissonconsulting.ca</a></p><hr><br><p>&#169; Copyright 1999, 2000, 2001, Joseph L.
