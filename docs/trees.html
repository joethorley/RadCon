Although there is only one type of Trees window RadCon actually recognises two types of tree - <ahref="#source and consensus trees" class="internal">source trees and consensus trees</a> - which have very different properties. RadCon also allows the user to <ahref="#selected and deselected trees" class="internal">select</a> a subset of trees on which to perform a number of commands.</p><a name="source and consensus trees"></a><hr><br><h2>Source and Consensus Trees</h2><p>A set of trees are read into RadCon as a set of source trees. A source tree is considered to represent an inferred evolutionary history. These histories can be <a href="manipulate.html" class="internal">manipulated</a> in various ways using the commands in the top half of the <a href="menus.html#source menu" class="internal">Source menu</a>. Consensus treesare very different from source trees - they represent sets of source trees as opposed to inferred patterns of evolution. A set of consensus trees (which often consists of a single tree) is created when a consensus method is applied to a set of source trees. <a href="manipulate.html" class="internal">Manipulation</a>  of consensus trees is not permitted as altering a consensus tree means it no longer correctly represents the set of source trees. For example the Adams consensus tree is only defined for a set of <a href="terms.html#root" class="internal">rooted</a> source trees. An unrooted Adams consensus tree is a nonsense. A set of consensus trees can however, like a set of source trees, be printed and saved and various <a href="measures.html" class="internal">tree measures</a> calculated. The commands that can be applied to both source and consensus trees are grouped in the <ahref="menus.html#trees menu" class="internal">Trees menu</a>.If the user wishes to manipulate a set of consensus trees they should save them to file and then read them back in as a set of source trees.</p><a name="selected and deselected trees"></a><hr><br><h2>Selected and Deselected Trees</h2><table height=229 width =213 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align =left hspace=12 name="treeswindow"><tr><td><img src="images/selectselectedtitlebar.gif" alt="titlebar" name="selecttitlebar" height=22 width=213 border=0></td></tr><tr><td><img src="images/selecttoolbar.gif" alt="tool bar" height=31width=213 border=0></td></tr><tr><td><img src="images/selectselectedtree.gif" alt="tree" name="selecttree" height=154 width=213 border=0></td></tr><tr><td><img src="images/selecttreenamebar.gif" alt="tree name bar" height=22 width=213 border=0></td></tr></table><p>RadCon allows the user to select a subset of trees for various <ahref="menus.html" class="internal">menu commands</a>, including saving, printing and <a href="analyse.html" class="internal">analysis</a> (if the trees are source trees) to operate on. It should be noted that commands which<a href="manipulate.html"class="internal">manipulate</a> a set of <ahref="#source and consensus trees" class="internal">source trees</a> (note: <a href="#source and consensus trees" class="internal">consensus trees</a> cannot be manipulated) operate on the complete set of source trees irrespective of whether they are selected or deselected and <a href="#active and inactive trees" class="internal">active or inactive</a>. By default all trees are read in as selected.</p>The subset of trees selected can be set using the commands in the submenu of the <b>Select Trees</b> <a href="menus.html#trees menu" class="internal">Trees menu</a> command. Alternatively each individual tree can be selected or deselected using the the <b>Select</b> button on the <a href="windows.html#select button"class="internal">Trees window toolbar</a>.</p><p>The user can determine the trees which are selected using the <b>Trees</b> command (in the submenu of the <b>Information</b> command in the Trees menu) which writes to the <a href="windows.html#log window"class="internal">Log window</a> the numbers of the selected trees.</p><p>In addition, a tree is drawn <a href = "#treeswindow"class = "textrollover"onMouseOver="setSelected()">blackened</a> or <a href = "#treeswindow"class = "textrollover"onMouseOver="setDeselected()">grayed</a>, in the Trees window, if it is selected or deselected, respectively.</p><br clear=all><br><a name="active and inactive trees"></a><hr><br><h2>Active and Inactive Trees</h2><p>In order for a <a href="terms.html#root" class="internal">rooted or unrooted</a> tree to be informative it must contain at least 3 or 4 <a href="terms.html#leaf" class="internal">leaves</a>, respectively. </p><p>Although RadCon checks each tree as it is <a href="input.html"class="internal">input</a> to ensure it is informative the relaxation of the requirement that trees in the same set have identical leaves (a requirement of many tree programs) introduces the possibility of tree <a href="manipulate.html"class="internal">manipulation</a> rendering a subset of trees uninformative. For example consider two rooted source trees with 3 and 4 leaves, respectively. Unrooting this set causes the tree with 3 leaves to become uninformative. RadCon handles this problem by 'inactivating' uninformative trees.An inactive tree is retained in memory but excluded from the set of treesto prevent it having any sort of influence. If subsequent manipulations render it informative again it is reinstated in the set of source trees in its original position. In addition, it is inserted in exactly the same position in the set and if prior to inactivation it was <a href="trees.html#selected and deselected trees" class="internal">selected</a> then it is added to the set of selected trees. Note: because <ahref="#source and consensus trees" class="internal">consensus trees</a> cannot be manipulated inactivation is a phenomenon confined to <ahref="#source and consensus trees" class="internal">source trees</a>.</p><p>The user can determine which trees are active using the <b>Trees</b> command (in the submenu of the <b>Information</b> command in the <a href="menus.html#trees menu" class="internal">Trees menu</a>) which writes to the <a href="windows.html#log window"class="internal">Log window</a> the numbers of the active trees.</p><!-- #include file=":INCLUDE:gototoc.html" --><hr><br><p>Go to the <a href="manual.html#contents" class="internal">Table of Contents</a>.</p><!-- /#include --><hr><br><!-- #lastmodified text="This page was last modified" form="long" -->This page was last modified May 3, 2001<!-- /#lastmodified --></p><!-- #include file=":INCLUDE:end.html" --><p>This page is maintained by <a HREF="mailto:joe@poissonconsulting.ca" class="external">joe@poissonconsulting.ca</a></p><hr><br><p>&#169; Copyright 1999, 2000, 2001, Joseph L.
