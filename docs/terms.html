A split corresponding to a terminal branch is <b>uninformative</b> as it does not reduce phylogenetic uncertainty. This is because the evolutionary separation of the leaf, at the tip of the terminal branch, from the other leaves in the tree is an assumption of the analysis, i.e., it is taken as given that the species (leaves) are evolutionarily distinct. On the other hand, a split corresponding to an internal branch is <b>informative</b>some of the possible phylogenetic relationships and reduces uncertainty.</p><p>A branch in a tree corresponds to a split on <em>all</em> the leaves under consideration (in the tree) and is referred to as a <b>full</b> split to distinguish it from a <b>partial</b> split - a split on a <em>subset</em> of the leaves under consideration. </p><p>The smallest possible informative rooted split is on three leaves and is called a <b>resolved triplet</b> whilst the smallest possible informative unrooted split is on four leaves and is called a <b>resolved quartet</b>. </p><p>A <span class="definition">nesting</span> is a statement that the most recent common ancestor of one set of leaves is a proper descendant of the most recent common ancestor of another set (<a href="references.html#adams:1986:n-trees" class="internal">Adams, 1986</a>). </p><a name="phylogenetic inference"></a><a name="phylogenetic reconstruction"></a><hr><br><h2>Phylogenetic Inference: Reconstructing Evolution</h2><p><a class="definition">Phylogenetic inference</a> is the process of constructing the phylogenetic tree(s) which best represents the evolutionary history of the set of species under consideration.

Thus it is important that phylogeneticists determine the confidence that can be placed in their trees.</p><p>The two most popular methods of assessing the support for phylogenetic relationships are the <a href="#bootstrap" class="internal">bootstrap</a> and <a href="#decay index" class="internal">decay index</a>.<a name="the bootstrap"></a><a name="bootstrap"></a><a name="bootstrapping"></a><a name="bootstrap proportion"></a><hr><br><h2>The Bootstrap</h2><p>The <span class="definition">bootstrap</span> (<a href="references.html#felsenstein:1985:confidence" class="internal">Felsenstein, 1985</a>) is amethod for assessing the stability of, or <a href="#assessing support" class="internal">support</a> for, phlyogeneticconclusions. The method involves the perturbation of the observed data through a process of 'resampling with replacement' to produce a large number(typically 100-1000) of modified data sets which are analysed separately. The resulting inferred phylogenies are then combined to produce a set of bootstrap trees. If a phylogenetic hypothesis is stable one would expect it to be largely unaffected by the perturbation process and to occur in a large proportion of the bootstrap trees.The <span class="definition">bootstrap proportion (BP)</span> of a phylogenetic hypothesis is, as it's name suggests, the proportion of bootstrap trees containing the hypothesis.</p><p>Phylogeneticists who have used the bootstrap to assess the stability of their results have typically only determined the BPs of the <a href="terms.html#branch" class="internal">internal branches</a>(<a href="terms.html#split" class="internal">full splits</a>) in their trees. However, considering only full splits can be misleading as even though all the full splits may have low BPs many <a href="terms.html#split" class="internal">partial splits</a> may be well supported by the data (<a href="references.html#wilkinson:1996:majority-rule" class="internal">Wilkinson, 1996</a>). </p><p>	RadCon provides the user with <a href="analyse.html#leaf stability (bootstrap) command">three</a> bootstrap 	based measures of <a href="analyse.html#leaf stability">leaf stability</a>.	</p><a name="decay index"></a><hr><br><h2>The Decay Index</h2><p>Another method for assessing the <a href="#assessing support" class="internal">support</a> for phylogenetic hypotheses is the <span class="definition">Decay Index (DI)</span> which also called theBremer Support value after it's developer (<a href="references.html#bremer:1988:limits" class="internal">Bremer, 1988</a>). The Decay Index of a phylogenetic hypothesis is the  length of the shortest tree(s) not containing the hypothesis minus the length of the shortest tree(s) containing it. Thus all the hypotheses common to all the MPTs  have positive DIs.  And the greater the increase in length (more steps) required to overturn a hypothesis then the greater its DI. DI provides a parsimony-based non-normalised (index is a misnomer here!), unbounded (within the limits of the dataset, of course) measure of the support for particular hypotheses. It should be noted that there is no reason why DI could not be calculated for optimality criterion other than parsimony, such as Maximum Likelihood (ML).   (Although it should be noted that RadCon currently  only handles length differences which are whole numbers which rules out the possibility of using ML as the optimality criterion.) </p> <p> Typically phylogeneticists have only calculated the DIs of <a href="terms.html#split" class="internal">full splits</a> (exceptions include <a href="references.html#dyke:thorley:1998:reduced " class="internal">Dyke and Thorley, 1998</a> and <a href="references.html#wilkinson:etal:2000:chain" class="internal">Wilkinson etal., 2000</a>).  But there is no reason why the DIs of smaller hypotheses such as triplets and quartets should not be calculated (<a href="references.html#wilkinson:etal:2000:chain" class="internal">Wilkinson etal., 2000</a>).   This is precisely what RadCon allows the phylogeneticist to do with it's <a href="analyse.html#leaf stability (decay index) command" class="internal">Leaf Stability (Decay Index)</a>  and <a href="analyse.html#double decay analysis command" class="internal">Double Decay Analysis</a> options.</p><!-- #include file=":INCLUDE:gototoc.html" --><hr><br><p>Go to the <a href="manual.html#contents" class="internal">Table of Contents</a>.</p><!-- /#include --><hr><br><!-- #lastmodified text="This page was last modified" form="long" -->This page was last modified May 3, 2001<!-- /#lastmodified --></p><!-- #include file=":INCLUDE:end.html" --><p>This page is maintained by <a HREF="mailto:joe@poissonconsulting.ca" class="external">joe@poissonconsulting.ca</a></p><hr><br><p>&#169; Copyright 1999, 2000, 2001, Joseph L.
